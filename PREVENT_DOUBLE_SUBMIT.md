## How It Works

### Before (Problem)
```
User clicks Submit → Request sent → User clicks again → Duplicate request → Multiple products created
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User clicks Submit → Button disabled → Spinner shown → Request sent → Success/Error → Button re-enabled
```

## Visual Feedback

### Submit Button States

**Normal State:**
```
[ Submit ]
```

**Processing State:**
```
[ ⟳ Processing... ] (disabled, grayed out)
```

**Delete Button Processing:**
```
[ ⟳ ] (spinning icon)
```

## Upload to Server

Upload this file:
```

→ /var/www/xscosmetic/resources/views/product/view.blade.php
```

No cache clear needed - just refresh the page!

## Summary

**Problem:** Slow server causes users to click submit multiple times, creating duplicate products

**Solution:** 
- Disable buttons immediately on click
- Show visual feedback (spinner + "Processing...")
- Prevent multiple submissions
- Re-enable on error for retry

**Result:** Users can no longer accidentally create duplicate products! ✅
